# nosql-challenge

## NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb:
###NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook containing the script for setting up a MongoDB database collection using the establishments.json file.
###The notebook imports the establishments.json data into a MongoDB database collection and performs necessary data cleaning.

##NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb:
###NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb is another Jupyter Notebook that focuses on exploring and analyzing the data within the MongoDB database collection created in the setup phase.
###The notebook likely includes queries, aggregations, and visualizations to gain insights from the establishment data.

##Resources:
##establishments.json: This JSON file serves as the data source for creating the MongoDB database collection. It contains information about various establishments, potentially including details like name, type, location, and hygiene scores.

##Challenge Purpose:
###The purpose of the challenge associated with this repository is to assess participants' proficiency in working with NoSQL databases, specifically MongoDB.
###Participants are expected to demonstrate skills in data cleaning, importing, querying, and analyzing data using Jupyter Notebooks.

##Potential Next Steps:
###After the initial setup and analysis, participants may be required to answer specific questions, create additional visualizations, or draw conclusions based on the insights obtained from the data.
###The challenge may involve extending the analysis, implementing advanced queries, or exploring more advanced features of MongoDB.
